  This plugin pushes items that lie on a Workbench automatically into a Chest 
  or Dispenser.
  The Chest/Dispenser can be seated directly besides the Workbench or be 
  connected to it via Redstone Wire of infinite length.
  Multiple Chests/Dispensers can be linked with Redstone Wire for in case a 
  Chest/Dispenser is full.
  Filtering is possible using Signs within the Redstone Wire line labeled with
  the english name of the Block/Item
    (see http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values ) or its decimal ID to 
    let that type 'pass' that Sign.
  Filtering multiple Blocks/Items is also possible by simply separating 
  their names/IDs by comma.

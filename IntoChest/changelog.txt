IntoChest Changelog
-------------------
1.6.0 Beta

atpx takes over as developer for joghurt.

-Better sign filter system!
---Removed matching a common name filter to any item with that name.
-----Ex: "stone" no longer will match with items like "cobblestone", "sandstone", etc.
---Deprecating support for wildcards (*) in signs.
-----In future versions wildcards will no longer be supported until otherwise announced.
-----Usage of wildcards was only meant as a bandaid for items that would not match.
---Support for filtering all items instead of just some. 
---Support for filtering items with sub-types (like spruce wood vs. oak wood).
---Support filter-matching using five naming systems.
-----Exact name: the exact name of the item ("coarse dirt")
-------Self-explanatory. The name of the item when you hover over it ingame.
-----Short name: the shortened, abbreviated name of the item based on a naming convention ("cdirt")
-------A short name of the item is derived from the first letter of every word that is not the last word + the first four letters of the last word of the item.
-----Group name: the name of a group that contains the item as part of the group ("dirts")
-------New groups have been created for items of similar types.
-----Exact identifier: the item decimal ID and the item data value delimited by a pipe ("3|1" would match coarse dirt).
-----ID identifier: the item decimal ID only. This will match against any type of that item ("3" would match with dirt, coarse dirt, and podzol).
-Better debug system!
---Overhauled debug messaging to better ascertain what is happening behind-the-scenes.
---You can now toggle debug messages for separate systems of the plugin.
-----general: General and miscellaneous messages
-----filter: Sign filtering messages and what signs are being checked and if the item is allowed or not.
-----pathing: Pathfinding messages of where the item is going.
-----runtime: Runtime messages on how long the plugin is taking.
---Commands
-----"/ic debug on|off": Toggle all debug messaging.
-----"/ic debug on|off general": Just toggle general debug messaging.
-----"/ic debug on|off filter": Just toggle filter debug messaging.
-----"/ic debug on|off pathing": Just toggle pathing debug messaging.
-----"/ic debug on|off runtime": Just toggle runtime debug messaging.
-Support for inspecting items to get valid identifiers for it or allowed/invalid items on a sign.
---Helpful for figuring out what to put on a sign in order for an item to be allowed to pass through the sign.
---Commands
-----"/ic inspect": Inspect the item in your hand or the sign you interact with just once
-----"/ic inspect on|off": Toggle inspect mode to be persistently on or off.
-New help command lists available commands for IntoChest.
---"/ic help"
-Fixes
---Checking if a chest is full for stackable items that do not have a max of 64 now checks correctly.
---Misc performance improvements.

1.3.1

-Last known stable release

This plugin pushes items that lie on a Workbench automatically into a Chest or Dispenser.
The Chest/Dispenser can be seated directly besides the Workbench or be connected to it via Redstone Wire of infinite length.
Multiple Chests/Dispensers can be linked with Redstone Wire for in case a Chest/Dispenser is full.
Filtering is possible using Signs within the Redstone Wire line labeled with the english name of the Block/Item (see http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values ) or its decimal ID to let that type 'pass' that Sign.
You can also use common parts of Block/Item names to group them, like "stairs" will fit for wooden, brick or stone stairs.
Filtering multiple Blocks/Items is also possible by simply separating their names/IDs by comma.
A nearer chest/dispenser is prefered over a more distant chest/dispenser, EXCEPT there's a sign involved: A filtered chest/dispenser is always preferred over a not filtered one!
